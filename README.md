# sentiment-analysis


In this paper, we present an algorithm to tackle the problem of
classification of sentiment in social media texts at large, i.e. movie
reviews, product reviews in e-commerce websites and social media
analysis, each consisting of single or multiple sentence(s) that most of
the time include pop culture texts.
